# Ralph Design Philosophy

## Core Principle

> **Validate First, Polish Later** - Get it working before making it pretty.

## The Workflow

```
Phase 1: Prototype  →  CHECKPOINT  →  Phase 2: Quality
(no tests/lint)       (manual verify)   (tests/lint/polish)
```

## CRITICAL RULES (Must Follow)

### In Prototype Mode (`RALPH_MODE=prototype`):
- NO unit tests
- NO e2e tests
- NO lint fixes
- NO edge cases
- Just make core functionality work
- Console.log / print() verification is OK

### At CHECKPOINT Task:
- PAUSE execution
- Notify user for manual verification
- Wait for human to test before Phase 2

### In Production Mode (`RALPH_MODE=production`):
- Write unit tests (pytest/vitest/jest)
- Fix lint errors
- Handle edge cases
- Code quality matters

## Why This Exists

Real case: Tests passed (5/5) but API was wrong. Hours wasted.

**Solution:** Human verifies core works BEFORE writing tests.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ralph-review <plan>` | Surface unclear requirements |
| `ralph-afk <plan> N auto prototype` | Phase 1: Make it work |
| `ralph-afk <plan> N auto production` | Phase 2: Add quality |
